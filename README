This is my system update script for Gentoo Linux.

It does / can do:

 - emerge sync
 - eix update
 - layman update (sync overlay repos)
 - fetch all packages (emerge -f)
 - emerge updated or changed packages
 - emerge version 9999 packages ('live ebuilds')
 - cfg-update (etc-update with better automatic merging)
 - skip packages based on regex list
 - provide a list of skipped or uncompleted updates
 - basic logging

Some of these need extra packages or options enabled

The idea is you can run this from cron e.g daily and keep most of your system up-to-date.
By adding to packages.noupdate, things that might break your system can be skipped.
